Here’s how you can pause and later resume your Chatwoot instance using Docker Compose:

---

## Stopping your Docker environment (without deleting data)

To pause all running containers (e.g., `postgres`, `redis`, `rails`, `sidekiq`):

```bash
docker compose stop
```

This command simply stops the containers but **retains their state**, including volumes and configurations. It’s quick and safe for temporary pauses. You can later bring them back up with:

```bash
docker compose start
```

From there, your application picks up exactly where it left off.
([Docker Documentation][1])

---

## Completely shutting down and cleaning up

If you want to stop AND remove containers, networks, and default volumes defined in your compose file—but **preserve named volumes**—you can run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

This is useful when you need a clean slate or are troubleshooting.
([Medium][2])

Later, to bring everything back up:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| To Do                                       | Command                | Action Taken                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Pause containers (keep data & configs)      | `docker compose stop`  | Stops containers, no removal                      |
| Resume paused containers                    | `docker compose start` | Starts only previously stopped containers         |
| Full teardown (remove containers, networks) | `docker compose down`  | Removes containers and networks, volumes still OK |
| Full restart of entire environment          | `docker compose up -d` | Recreates containers from scratch                 |
| Update code or settings, preserve data      | `docker compose up -d` | No loss of data in named volumes                  |

## Best practices for managing your Chatwoot stack

* **Routine pausing**: Use `stop` / `start`.
* **Major changes or debugging**: Use `down` followed by `up -d`.
* **Updating environment variables** (`.env` changes): Use `docker compose restart`, or best—`down` then `up -d` to fully apply changes.
  ([Docker Documentation][3], [Docker Community Forums][4], [geeksforgeeks.org][5], [Reddit][6], [Medium][2])

### Example workflow:

```bash
# To pause:
docker compose stop

# Later, resume:
docker compose start

# If making major changes (e.g. Chatwoot upgrade in compose file):
docker compose down
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

That’s it! This approach keeps your data intact while giving you effortless control over starting and stopping your Chatwoot stack. Let me know if you’d like help automating this workflow with scripts or aliases.

Awesome find — and yep, if the issue you hit was fixed in a recent Chatwoot release, the fastest path is to **pull the newest image, recreate the app, and retest the widget**.

Here’s a clean, step-by-step “from your current compose” plan on Windows PowerShell, plus a quick widget test that should work once you’re on the fixed build.

# 1) Upgrade to the latest Chatwoot release

Chatwoot publishes monthly/regular releases; the official Docker image tag `chatwoot/chatwoot:latest` tracks the newest stable build.

```powershell
# from your chatwoot-docker folder
docker compose pull
docker compose down

# (optional) if you previously experimented with different images,
# make sure nothing else is holding port 3000
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# bring up DB + Redis first
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# run migrations/prepare with the upgraded image
docker compose run --rm rails bundle exec rails db:chatwoot_prepare

# start the app & workers
docker compose up -d rails sidekiq

# watch the app logs until you see "Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000"
docker compose logs -f rails
```

# 2) Double-check env that affects the widget

In your **.env** (you already have this, just reconfirm):

* `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`
* `BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`
* Leave `RAILS_ENV=production` for compose.
* Keep Redis/Postgres as you set them.

If you change `.env`, restart rails so it picks up the new values:

```powershell
docker compose restart rails
```

# 3) Hard refresh the SDK (avoid cached `sdk.js`)

Browsers aggressively cache `packs/js/sdk.js`. Force a fresh fetch:

* Open DevTools → Network → check “Disable cache” → refresh
* Or add a cache-buster to the script URL like `.../sdk.js?v=2025-08-20`

# 4) Create/verify a Website Inbox and copy its token

In Chatwoot ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)), go to **Settings → Inboxes → Add Inbox → Website**, finish the wizard, and copy the **Website Token** shown in the install snippet (it looks like what you posted). The docs/UI guide for the SDK is here if you want more options later. ([chatwoot.com][1])

# 5) Test the widget from a simple page (served on any port)

You **do not** need Nginx for local widget testing. The page can live on a different port; the **`baseUrl` must point to your Chatwoot app (port 3000)**. (Nginx is typically used for TLS/domains in production, not for getting the widget to show locally.)

Make a file next to where you’ll run your static server, e.g. **widget-test.html**:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Chatwoot Widget Smoke Test</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Widget test</h1>

  <script>
    // optional UI preferences (from the Chatwoot snippet)
    window.chatwootSettings = {
      position: "right",
      type: "expanded_bubble",
      launcherTitle: "Chat with us"
    };

    (function(d,t){
      var BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000";  // MUST be http://localhost:3000
      var g = d.createElement(t), s = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];
      g.src = BASE_URL + "/packs/js/sdk.js?v=cachebust";
      g.async = true; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
      g.onload = function(){
        window.chatwootSDK.run({
          websiteToken: "PASTE_YOUR_WEBSITE_TOKEN_HERE",
          baseUrl: BASE_URL
        });
      };
    })(document,"script");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Serve it on any free port (not 3000, since rails is using 3000):

```powershell
npx http-server . -p 3100
# then browse http://localhost:3100/widget-test.html
```

If everything’s good, you’ll see the bubble at bottom-right and messages will land in your Website inbox.

# 6) If you still see “Invalid Protocol” in console

That error is thrown by the SDK when the **`baseUrl` isn’t a valid http/https URL** (e.g., `0.0.0.0`, `file://`, or a malformed value). The fix is to make sure **`baseUrl` is exactly `http://localhost:3000`** and that your rails container logs show it’s listening on `0.0.0.0:3000`. (Recent releases continue to ship the SDK via `/packs/js/sdk.js` and the Website integration flow remains the same. ([chatwoot.com][1]))

# 7) Pin to a specific version (recommended)

To avoid surprises from “latest”, pin the image once you confirm the fix works. For example, if the current stable is **v4.2.0**:

```yaml
image: chatwoot/chatwoot:v4.2.0
```

You can see the current version numbers and notes on the releases page and changelog. ([chatwoot.com][2])

---

If you want, paste back the first \~50 lines of `docker compose logs -f rails` after the upgrade. I’ll sanity-check that Puma bound to `0.0.0.0:3000` and that no env var is fighting the URL the SDK expects.

Upgrade Guide For Chatwoot
You’re welcome—I’m glad the v4.5.2 upgrade resolved the widget and dashboard issues! If at some point you want to upgrade to an even newer Chatwoot release, you can use the official procedure you quoted. Here’s a concise explanation of each step:

1. **Pull updated images**

   ```bash
   # From your chatwoot-docker folder
   docker compose pull
   ```

2. **Stop the existing containers**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

   This cleanly stops Rails, Sidekiq, PostgreSQL and Redis. It also frees up port 3000.

3. **Ensure nothing else is listening on port 3000 (optional)**

   ```bash
   docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}"
   ```

   If you see another container binding to port 3000, stop it.

4. **Start only PostgreSQL and Redis**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgres redis
   ```

5. **Run the database preparation/migrations on the new image**

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm rails bundle exec rails db:chatwoot_prepare
   ```

   This creates any new tables or columns required by the upgrade.

6. **Start Rails and Sidekiq**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d rails sidekiq
   ```

   After a few moments, you should see `Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000` in the logs.

7. **Watch the logs (optional)**

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f rails
   ```

   This helps verify that the server has started and there are no errors.

Following those steps will keep your containers and database up to date without losing data. Since you’re already on v4.5.2 and it’s working, there’s no immediate need to upgrade unless a new release appears. When it does, these commands will make the process smooth.

SIMPLE SETUP EVERYTIME
# Stop running Chatwoot containers
docker compose down

# Start PostgreSQL and Redis first
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# Prepare the database (if you haven’t already)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d chatwoot -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
docker compose run --rm rails bundle exec rails db:chatwoot_prepare

# Start Rails and Sidekiq again
docker compose up -d rails sidekiq
